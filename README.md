# Job Search App

Simulation of a job search app, allowing a tradie to see their jobs.

This application focuses on the front-end part, made with typescript react and tailwind.

I used, a JSON file to list the jobs which more jobs can be added or removed if needed.

By default, it displays the general informations like title, creation date and time and the status of each job.

Users can sort (either by alphabettically or by dates), filter (by the job status) or search the jobs (by the title of the job).

User can click the button to see the details of the job and user can make notes, edit or remove existing notes on the job.

The job status and the notes are stored in the localstorage of the browser, allowing users to come back and see their previous notes and check the status.
